  <p>No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it. Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours. I don't like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there's too many fat children.</p>
<p>And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold. I stand by my racial slur.</p>
<p>I was saying "Boo-urns. " Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix. And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker. Uh, no, you got the wrong number. <strong> This is 9-1â€¦2.</strong> <em> Fame was like a drug.</em> But what was even more like a drug were the drugs.</p>

<li>When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV!</li><li>Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work.</li><li>I'll be back. You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever, and when they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies.</li>
